);

-- 5. Establish a virtual table that displays comprehensive details of all orders that have been shipped. You only need to show the order number, order date, shipped date, customername, and employee number.
CREATE VIEW ShippedOrdersDetails AS
SELECT

    e.employeeNumber
FROM

JOIN 
    Employees e ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber
WHERE

    c.customerNumber,
    c.customerName
FROM 
    Employees e, Customers c
WHERE
    e.employeeNumber = c.salesRepEmployeeNumber;

            AVG(quantityInStock)
        FROM 
            Products
        WHERE 
            productLine = p.productLine
    );


-- 8. Establish a virtual table that showcases the payment history of customers. Display the name of the customers, the order number, the date of payment, and the amount paid
CREATE VIEW PaymentHistory AS
SELECT

    p.paymentDate,
    p.amount
